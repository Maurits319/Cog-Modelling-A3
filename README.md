## Cognitive Modeling Project README

## Description
Welcome to the Tower of Hanoi project using ACT-R! This project implements the classic Tower of Hanoi problem within the ACT-R cognitive architecture framework. It simulates a cognitive agent solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, where the agent must move disks between pegs according to the puzzleâ€™s rules: only one disk can be moved at a time, and no larger disk can be placed on top of a smaller one.
